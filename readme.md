<h1>Pomodoro Timer ‚è≥</h1>

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is designed to help individuals improve their productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the Italian word for "tomato," as Cirillo initially used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to track his work intervals.
